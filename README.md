Game `%start`!! (start a game with `%start`)

Basically, you are given 9 images from [Safebooru](https://safebooru.donmai.us/). You goal is to identify which tag is shared between all the images.

Every few seconds, a new letter of the tag will be revealed to you! But if you take too long and the whole tag is revealed, you'll lose...
Be sure to guess in time~

Here's what a game looks like:
